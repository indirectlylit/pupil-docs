**Coming soon!** We are finishing up work on a new version of Pupil Invisible Monitor, which will allow you to easily monitor and remote-control all Pupil Invisible devices in your local network from your browser.

Until then, you can still use the old [Pupil Invisible Monitor desktop app](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil-invisible-monitor).
