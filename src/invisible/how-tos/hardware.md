   closest to the nose pad.

## How to clean the glasses?
Pupil Invisible Glasses contain cameras and sensitive electronic components, do not rinse or wet-clean.

- Glasses lenses can be cleaned with the provided microfiber cloth.
- Scene camera and eye camera lenses can be carefully cleaned with the provided microfiber cloth if dust is visible.
- The nose pads can be cleaned with an alcohol based disinfectant applied on a damp cloth

### Disinfecting Frames
All Pupil Invisible eye tracking glasses are cleaned with disinfectant prior to shipping. You may want to disinfect the frames between uses.

The disinfectant we use is made from 22.0g Ethanol, 21.0g 2-Propanol, 8.0g 1-Propanol per 100 grams of solution. One such brand name that we use is "Vibasept". We use the wetted towlettes (wipes). Similar products should be available globally under different brand names.

Pupil Invisible is not water resistant. When cleaning, be careful around the eye cameras, world camera, and USB connection. Liquid from disinfectant might damage sensitive electronics inside the frame.

## How to attach the head strap?

The head strap is an accessory that can be purchased if you want to use Pupil Invisible while playing sports or in other dynamic activities. The head strap can be adjusted to fit most wearers by pulling the two tabs.

Clip the strap connector onto the arms of your Pupil Invisible glasses. The cable should be on top of the glasses arms. The open side of the clip should be on the inside of the glasses frame. See the image for reference.
