<v-divider></v-divider>

### 1. Set up your new Companion Device.

The Companion Device included in your Pupil Invisible box is a new device. It has never been turned on, so it will require setup.

Create a new Google account or use an existing Google account during setup.

### 2. Install and start Pupil Invisible Companion App.
Next, you have to install the Pupil Invisible Companion app on your device:
- Launch the **Google Play Store** app. It is already installed by default on your Companion Device.
- Search for **Pupil Invisible Companion** in the Google Play Store and click install.
- Start the Pupil Invisible Companion app when the installation has finished.
- A couple of permission prompts will appear, which you have to accept.
- First-time users need to sign up for a Pupil Cloud account. You can sign up using your Google account, or by creating an account with an email address and password.

### 3. Enable Recording Upload to Pupil Cloud (optional)
- As part of the setup process, you can enable uploading recordings to Pupil Cloud.
- Pupil Cloud is an online storage and analysis platform for eye tracking recordings. It makes it easy to get recordings off of the phone and includes various algorithms for processing them. Uploading data to Pupil Cloud is optional, but some features are not available without it (e.g. obtaining the 200 Hz gaze signal).
- You can change this setting at any time in the settings of the app.


### 4. Connect your glasses
Connect the Pupil Invisible glasses to your Companion device using the Connector Cable. A series of permission prompts will appear. Tap "Use by default for this USB device" and "OK".

::: tip
Always use the Connector Cable that came with your Pupil Invisible! If you are using a 3rd party USB-C to USB-C cable you might experience issues with the stability of your connection.

### 5. Create your first Wearer
Pupil Invisible distinguishes who is wearing the glasses with **wearer profiles**. Create a new wearer for who is going to wear Pupil Invisible first!

### 6. Open the live Preview
Now, let's see some eye tracking in action! 
- The **scene and eye camera icons** in the app's home screen should be colored, indicating that the glasses are connected (otherwise the icons would be gray). 
- You can see a live stream of the scene video with a gaze overlay by clicking the **Preview** button.

Just put on the glasses and try!

To make a recording, hit the big red button on the home screen to start. Once you are done hit the button again and hit save.

### 8. Playback and download

Navigate to the **Recordings view** and click the recording you just made to play it! If you enabled the upload of recordings to Pupil Cloud, you should see that the recording has already started uploading!
